Welcome to Appcelerator Titanium Mobile Project

This project is to test a custom navigation bar to imitate iOS behavior NavGroup in Android devices.
It works as native in iOS and imitation in Android.

In the "backButton" branch you will find a way to control the physical Android back button to avoid app to close, while controlling the PAUSE/RESUME activity events.

You can find screenshots in the screenshots folder.
