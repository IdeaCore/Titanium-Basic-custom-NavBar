Welcome to Appcelerator Titanium Mobile Project

This project is to test a custom navigation bar to imitate iOS behavior NavGroup in Android devices.
It works as native in iOS and imitation in Android.

In the "backButton" branch you will find a way to control the physical Android back button to avoid app to close, while controlling the PAUSE/RESUME activity events.
Also, in the iOS7 branch, the navigator was changed to support the new Titanium NavigationWindow for iOS 7.

You can find screenshots in the screenshots folder (also for iOS7 branch).
